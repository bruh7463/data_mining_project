### Problem Statement
Wikipedia pages related to Zambia have fewer local contributions than international ones. There is little understanding of where the contributors of Zambian-related pages come from, including the Zambia page. Without this information, it is difficult to create specific strategies that boost contributions from Zambian Wikipedians. The goal is to find out and categorize the origins of Wikipedia users who contribute to Zambian pages. This will help in planning actions that promote more local involvement.
