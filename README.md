# **1. Business Understanding**
### Problem Statement
Wikipedia pages related to Zambia have fewer local contributions than international ones. There is little understanding of where the contributors of Zambian-related pages come from, including the Zambia page. Without this information, it is difficult to create specific strategies that boost contributions from Zambian Wikipedians. The goal is to find out and categorize the origins of Wikipedia users who contribute to Zambian pages. This will help in planning actions that promote more local involvement.

### Business Objective
• Identify the percentage of contributions to Zambian Wikipedia articles by users from Zambia compared to other nations.
• Provide practical advice to guide strategies for Zambian-based contributions.
• Support The University of Zambia's DataLab Research Group in advocating for greater representation of local perspectives on Wikipedia.
• Enable long-term monitoring of contribution by country of origin.
